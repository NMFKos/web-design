Contributing Guidelines
=======================

## Got a bug?

As much as possible please provide a minimal reproducible case. The best way to do this
is with a pull request including breaking tests!

## Got a feature idea?

We'd love to discuss it! Feel free to submit an issue. Just try to be as descriptive as you can
and preferably include code/output examples since that can really help.

## Developing Atlas

At an absolute minimum make sure `npm test` runs! :)
